      <p>My mother told me I was born during a heavy downpour. This has always made me feel a sense of connection with rain. Hmm.. I just told you something irrelevant because it would be weird to start this piece with - &ldquo;The calm before the storm&rdquo;. Anyway, after the storm, there&rsquo;s also a calm. In this case, you could imagine a deafening pitch of a new born baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm before a calm&rdquo;. Why is there never a smooth road to good or bad? Even as you&rsquo;re looking to learn something, like a new skill, there are stages you&rsquo;d encounter, no matter how smart you are.</p>
<p>This brings me to the 5 stages of learning</p>
<h3 id="1-enthusiasm">1. <strong>Enthusiasm</strong> <a href="#1-enthusiasm" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>When you see a master at work, every thing they do looks easy. With your beginner&rsquo;s mind, you tend to underestimate the complexity of a topic because of the intro tutorials on youtube. This is a good thing if you enjoy what you&rsquo;re learning, but it&rsquo;s important that you define a clear roadmap, so you can anticipate the challenges ahead.</p>
<h3 id="2-feeling-of-genius">2. <strong>Feeling of Genius</strong> <a href="#2-feeling-of-genius" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>It&rsquo;s easy to fall into the genius trap when the topic is simple to grasp but hard to master. For example, a front end developer using javascript could pick up python in less than a month. But that&rsquo;s not all there is about learning python. You need to spend a lot of time mastering design patterns, working with frameworks like Django and learning industry-specific application of python.</p>
<h3 id="3-self-doubt">3. <strong>Self-Doubt</strong> <a href="#3-self-doubt" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>This stage is common among beginners who pick up a hard skill to learn. They can fall into this loop of Self-Doubt to Enthusiasm to Feeling of Genius and back to Self Doubt. Just know that it&rsquo;s normal to have questions that need answers, and that&rsquo;s why you should be a part of a <a href="https://ndz.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community</a> that can help you in those tough moments. However, self-doubt is <a href="https://journal.ndz.ng/not-imposter-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not imposter syndrome</a>. Competence breeds confidence.</p>
<h3 id="4-awareness">4. <strong>Awareness</strong> <a href="#4-awareness" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>While having self doubt, what helps you get through is identifying your areas of weakness. Identify what you don&rsquo;t know and what you think you know. Focus on these weaknesses until they become strengths.</p>
<h3 id="5-mastery">5. <strong>Mastery</strong> <a href="#5-mastery" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>This is the final stage of learning, where everything looks easy but you are constantly looking to make things better, thereby pushing you to go through the 5 stages of learning again. And then, it never ends.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Enjoy what you do, and you won&rsquo;t care to read this piece again</p>
