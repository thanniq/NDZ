      <p>I once told a friend the difference between success and failure can be measured by distance.</p>
<p>Imagine these statements - The Kamiyes are 80KM richer than the Ademoyes. The Falolas are 10KM poorer than the Felixs&rsquo;. Sounds weird right?</p>
<p>But it exemplifies the impact of location in who and what you become in life.</p>
<p>If you spend your entire life in the same place, you stand a high chance of becoming poorer than a lot of your high school class mates who moved to a different town or state.</p>
<p>What influences the gap between the volume of sales among competitors in Balogun Market, Lagos Island, can be as simple as one busy crossroad. As a kid, I&rsquo;ve had to buy in stores that are closer to walking lanes, instead of crossing to the other side of the road.</p>
<p>What does my little money add to the billions of naira exchanged in that market? But imagine the number of people who don&rsquo;t like crossing roads or walking many stairs to buy something they could have gotten somewhere close.</p>
<p>This implies some stores won&rsquo;t make many sales because some buyers prioritize convenience and are risk-averse. That&rsquo;s positioning in action.</p>
<p>Just 8 - 15 km away from Balogun market, are Lekki, Victoria Island, Ikoyi. In these locations, you&rsquo;d find the rich, richest, and old money of Lagos. This little distance can be the difference in living in poverty and thinking rich.</p>
<p>We could dream to be anything, but before most things can be done, you have to move a distance. Even in your house, you have to move around to get things done.</p>
<p>Proximity to opportunities is wealth, power and peace. Don&rsquo;t try to bend the world to your tune. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to your space. The human mind is like an empty city with vast lands. You have to fill that city with big buildings, cars and anything good in life.</p>
<p>Staying in one place can&rsquo;t help with that. You can&rsquo;t stretch the length of your own imagination, if you stay in the same place for a long time.</p>
<p>If you feel stuck, like nothing is changing, then it&rsquo;s time for a change. A physical change in distance gives you a mental shift. Grab your bag, rent a hotel for a few days, stay with a friend/cousin in another town or move to a new state.</p>
<p>Also, the internet is also a form of virtual space. If some parts of the internet feels restricting, move. Change platform. Be in control.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: Positioning is key</strong></p>
