      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like balancing on a rope, delusion is a fine line between reality and optimism. You could know all the answers (hmm, do you?) and still be deluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Jackson is regarded as one of, if not the greatest musician of all time. When he died, about 12 fans committed suicide because of the pain. He is an inpiration to many.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of the saying &amp;ldquo;artsier than the nerds, nerdier than the artists&amp;rdquo;?. It&amp;rsquo;s a dichotomy of skill, believe, philosophy or anything that gives you competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of the Lindy effect? It&amp;rsquo;s a concept that means - &lt;strong&gt;If something has been around for a long time, the longer it will be&lt;/strong&gt;. You can apply this idea to almost every area of your life, from investing to consumption, learning, life choices, and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Isale Eko, a 🤐 part of Lagos Island. As a young boy, when I went to places like Victoria Island, Ajah, and Lekki, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think about what it would feel like to be rich.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing feels close to the freedom you have as a student when you&amp;rsquo;re done with exams in secondary school. During the few days before going on term break, teachers don&amp;rsquo;t enforce rules and anything goes. School clubs sometimes organize career seminars, where some teachers are invited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Storm Before A Calm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My mother told me I was born during a heavy downpour. This has always made me feel a sense of connection with rain. Hmm.. I just told you something irrelevant because it would be weird to start this piece with - &amp;ldquo;The calm before the storm&amp;rdquo;. Anyway, after the storm, there&amp;rsquo;s also a calm. In this case, you could imagine a deafening pitch of a new born baby.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There I was, looking back at about 300 pairs of eyes. &amp;ldquo;Quowam, Dance,&amp;rdquo; a teacher shouted from behind. It was our annual End of the Year party, and it&amp;rsquo;s a usual thing for teachers to drag students out at random to entertain &amp;ldquo;the audience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;18 years ago, I remember marching with some other classmates, singing &amp;ldquo;sandalili, sandalili&amp;rdquo;. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my childhood now, knowing it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;standard living&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How NDZ can change your life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procrastination. Overthinking. Demotivation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of us suffer from one or two of these problems. Whether you’re broke or stuck, it’s okay to be true to yourself and admit that help is needed. As humans, we’re endlessly recreating ourselves. But we fail to see it because of the script we were given by society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Change in Distance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I once told a friend the difference between success and failure can be measured by distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine these statements - The Kamiyes are 80KM richer than the Ademoyes. The Falolas are 10KM poorer than the Felixs&amp;rsquo;. Sounds weird right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything like me – a polymath, a generalist, or whatever you call yourself; here’s an article you want to read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I had a lot of questions. How do I pretend not to be interested in the things I enjoy doing? Why don’t people love to diversify? If it’s best to be a master of one, why do we love choices?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t quit social media. Yes, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s time you faced the truth that social media is here to stay. Everyone and their grandmother are now on social media. It has become part of us and we can’t run from it. We learn, trade, connect, and work from it&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In about 10 minutes, I finished watching a thought-provoking motivational piece that advised me to get to the grind and work harder than my peers. I jumped off the bed, took a bath, brushed my hair, and wrote new goals on a piece of paper. Then I tucked the paper in an old book and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
