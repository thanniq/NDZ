      <p><mark><strong>Procrastination. Overthinking. Demotivation.</strong></mark></p>
<p>Many of us suffer from one or two of these problems. Whether you’re broke or stuck, it’s okay to be true to yourself and admit that help is needed. As humans, we’re endlessly recreating ourselves. But we fail to see it because of the script we were given by society.</p>
<p>You can achieve any goal on your terms if you&rsquo;re ready to take action. But it’s easier said than done!</p>
<p>You’re just seconds away from the community you need to learn, earn, create &amp; grow. It is a perfect mix of mind-shifting, life-changing &amp; unique.</p>
<p><strong>Let me know if any of these sounds familiar:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You’re under 30 with no clear career or life goal.</li>
<li>You are struggling with procrastination. Almost everything in your life can be done tomorrow.</li>
<li>You’re a chronic overthinker. Great ideas die in your imagination because you can’t stop thinking about them.</li>
<li>You lack motivation. Today you’re 100% on top of your game. Tomorrow, you feel empty and uninterested in anything.</li>
<li>You just want to make money. It’s the only thing that matters to you but you don’t know how.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need a community you can call yours. A platform you can call home.</p>
<p>Imagine having an opportunity to solve these problems. What would you do differently?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to…</p>
<h2 id="no-distraction-zone-ndz"><mark><strong>No Distraction Zone</strong> (NDZ)</mark> <a href="#no-distraction-zone-ndz" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>A private community for passionate individuals and remote workers. It’s a community of life travelers!</p>
<p>This community is created to help YOU:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become a better, sophisticated version of yourself.</li>
<li>Finally, become a ruthless executor who’s focused on getting results. When others talk, you do!</li>
<li>Become infinitely better at managing your time and getting more done in less time with less stress.</li>
<li>Tap into the collective knowledge of a community of creators and mentors who are there to support and collaborate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-ndz-different">What makes NDZ different? <a href="#what-makes-ndz-different" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><ul>
<li>You’ll get honest ways to make money online and become a better person. No get-rich-quick schemes.</li>
<li>Less is More. We adopt a minimalist philosophy in our words and actions to achieve clear-cut focus in our work and life.</li>
</ul>
<p>We celebrate the process as much as we do for results. We teach what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<h2 id="who-ndz-is-for">Who NDZ is For <a href="#who-ndz-is-for" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><ul>
<li>Individuals who need help with guides and resources to learn a new skill and become a better version of themselves</li>
<li>Freelancers who wants to monetize their skills but don&rsquo;t know how</li>
<li>Individuals who need a thriving community of like-minded peers to share their struggles with.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-ndz-is-not-for">Who NDZ is NOT For <a href="#who-ndz-is-not-for" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re looking for some “done-for-you” money-making schemes.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re looking for a cult to join. This is simply a private community with a unique approach to learning.</li>
<li>Complainers or people with a victim mindset. Part of joining the community is letting go of blame and taking charge of your growth.</li>
