      <p>There I was, looking back at about 300 pairs of eyes. &ldquo;Quowam, Dance,&rdquo; a teacher shouted from behind. It was our annual End of the Year party, and it&rsquo;s a usual thing for teachers to drag students out at random to entertain &ldquo;the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you dance?&rdquo; she shouted again.</p>
<p>While many would think I was shy, I knew that wasn&rsquo;t the case. It was just pure incompetence. If I tried to dance, they&rsquo;d probably laugh louder than the music in the background. Anyway, I danced, moving as fast as I could, and ignoring the haters.</p>
<p>However, in some public events, I was that boy who read Ewi (poem), in the Yoruba language. I did this almost every year, until graduation. While my mates were preparing for English dance drama and impressing girls, I was there, battling with poems like &ldquo;Ise logun ise&rdquo; (a popular Yoruba poem). To be honest, I was proud of representing my culture. But, I still wondered why I felt like an imposter every time.</p>
<p>Focus on two keywords - Incompetence and Imposter. Today, many beginners mix them up.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome is where, despite clear evidence of your skills and accomplishments, you feel like you do not deserve recognition. You cannot be an imposter if you&rsquo;re yet to demonstrate competence.</p>
<p>Spend a lot of time honing your craft or skill. Preparation breeds confidence. Confidence breeds competence.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome has no cure, and it&rsquo;s something you should own. Even if you&rsquo;re the most powerful human on earth, you&rsquo;d still at some point feel like an imposter. So, spend less time worrying about it.</p>
<p>Summary: <strong>Focus on competence</strong></p>
