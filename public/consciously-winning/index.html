      <p>I grew up in Isale Eko, a 🤐 part of Lagos Island. As a young boy, when I went to places like Victoria Island, Ajah, and Lekki, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about what it would feel like to be rich.</p>
<p>Even with my naive mind, I murmur to myself, many of these rich people don&rsquo;t know how hard life is. Yeah, that&rsquo;s stereotyping but it doesn&rsquo;t make it any less true.</p>
<p>Being too comfortable can make you feel out of touch. You become unconscious of your wins and dwell in rejoicing, which eventually leads to mistakes. Hence, losses.</p>
<p>This brings me to the recent AFCON final between Nigeria and Ivory Coast. First, I don&rsquo;t think we have a great team. Call it luck or talent, we got to the final. But if it&rsquo;s anything, a final should be your best opportunity to prove to the world that you didn&rsquo;t game your way to success. Instead, I saw a set of players who had rejoiced in their past winnings and assumed it was going to be that way.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-3-mindtras-to-be-a-conscious-winner">There are 3 mindtras to be a conscious winner <a href="#there-are-3-mindtras-to-be-a-conscious-winner" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p><strong>1. Recognize that you&rsquo;ve won</strong> - Take a moment to digest your win. This could be a 1 hr break, a day off work, dinner with your team or overnight party with your friends. It&rsquo;s important to note the little or big wins, so you don&rsquo;t blur the lines between milestones and become unaware of your growth.</p>
<p><strong>2. Recognize that a loss is coming</strong> - The mission hasn&rsquo;t ended. You or your business will take a loss some hour, day, week or month. You just won&rsquo;t know when. Keeping this in mind will help you stay conscious of the traps of overrejoice. You smile and frown at the same time, like Kanye.</p>

<p><strong>3. Recognize that the day is long</strong> - As you go through many rounds of wins and losses, know that it never ends until it&rsquo;s done. This prepares your mind for a tough journey without giving up. You&rsquo;ve planned and that&rsquo;s how long it takes to complete a goal. Stick with it.</p>
<p><strong>Summary -</strong> Play the long and short game, like a tai chi master who&rsquo;s trying to bend the wind.</p>
