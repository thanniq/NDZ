## How can you apply the Lindy Effect?

- "Hard work + long time" breeds success. This will always be true, even if the world is run by robots.
- If it can be done simply, do it simple. If 1 + 1 = 2, you shouldn't be looking for how 4-2 or 5-3 can be 2.
- Emotions are short-lived. Rely on things that are persistent like the love of your parents.
- Read old books with timeless wisdom.
- Stocks like the S&P 500 give positive returns over the years, no matter the economic situation. Invest, Ignore, Forget.
- An eye for an eye is a reliable way to manage human interactions. Be nice, but look out for yourself.
- Racism, Bigotry, Tribalism, and Ageism are human nature. Don't make it personal.
- Except for sex, people don't like most things forever. Accept diminishing returns as part of life, whether you're a popular figure or you own a popular thing.
- Mentors are the guiding lights of life. Find one.
- Persuasion is how you get people to do anything you want. Not physical attractiveness or money.
- Every human has a skeleton in their cupboard. Even your favorite prophets.
- Love deep. No reward for being a hard nut.

**Summary** - Some things do not change in life, like human psychology, instinct, numbers, and economic forces. Also, understand that most things are short-lived, even if they look like the best thing to ever happen to you or mankind.
