+++I grew up in Isale Eko, a ü§ê part of Lagos Island. As a young boy, when I went to places like Victoria Island, Ajah, and Lekki, I couldn't help but think about what it would feel like to be rich.

Even with my naive mind, I murmur myself, many of these rich people don't know how hard life is. Yeah, that's stereotyping but it doesn't make it any less true.

Being comfortable can make you feel out of touch. You start being unconscious of your wins and dwell in rejoicing, which eventually leads to mistakes. Hence, losses.

This brings me to the recent AFCON final between Nigeria and Ivory Coast. First, I don't think we have a great team. Call it luck or talent, we got to the final. But if it's anything, a final should be your best opportunity to prove to the world that you didn't game your way to success. Instead, I saw a set of players who had rejoiced in their past winnings and assumed it was going to be that way.

## There are 3 mindtras to be a conscious winner

**1. Recognize that you've won** - Take a moment to digest your win. This could be a 1 hr break, a day off work, dinner with your team or overnight party with your friends. It's important to note the little or big wins, so you don't blur the lines between milestones and become unaware of your growth.

**2. Recognize that a loss is coming** - The mission hasn't ended. You or your business will take a loss some hour, day, week or month. You just won't know when. Keeping this in mind will help you stay conscious of the traps of overrejoice. You smile and frown at the same time, like Kanye.

**3. Recognize that the day is long** - As you go through many rounds of wins and losses, know that it never ends until it's done. This prepares your mind for a tough journey without giving up. You've planned and that's how long it takes to complete a goal. Stick with it.

**Summary -** Play the long and short game, like a tai chi master who's trying to bend the wind.
