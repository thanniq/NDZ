+++When you hear the word "remote", you probably think of "remote control" - that thing we use to change our TV channels. And you know how they can always be missing in action. Just when you need them, they disappear.

Imagine the pain of operating the TV using the physical buttons alone. Remote controls know how valuable they are, and they make us suffer for it.

This reflects on the notion of connection, convenience, and collaboration. How much our lives can be better when we manage to tick all of these 3Cs.

In recent years, remote work has become a popular and flexible way of conducting business. From your room, you can connect with customers, work in your pyjamas and collaborate with colleagues. Jeff Atwood, an American software developer said ‚Äú**Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.‚Äù** I'd paraphrase this to say ‚Äú**Any work that can be done remotely, will eventually be done remotely.‚Äù**

The exact number of people working remotely in the world is unknown, but it is estimated that between **7% and 16%** of the global workforce worked remotely in 2022. There's never a better time than now to jump ship, before the whole world is on the internet.

## Pros of Remote Work üôÇ

As a freelancer or employee, remote work offers:

**Flexibility:** You can choose to work from anywhere. How and when work is done is determined by your employer or the work structure you set for yourself. Remote work is no different from working in an office. You are accountable for tasks given to you within working hours.

**Increased productivity:** This is a consequence of working with less commute and in an environment where there's minimum distraction. Don't expect to be productive because you work remotely. If you are disorganized in your digital or physical life, remote work might decrease your productivity.

## Cons of Remote Work üôÅ

**Micromanagement:** In everything in life, there are usually bad actors. Some remote workers tend to show poor accountability for their actions, thereby leading to micromanagement from the employers. Also, some companies have poor workflows that leads to micromanagement by the managers.

**Blurred work-life boundaries:** Poor time management or unclear expectations can lead to work bleeding beyond work hours. Also, a demanding work environment can take a lot of your personal time.
